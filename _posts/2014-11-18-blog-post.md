Vahram had his paper about intrinsic magnetoresistance in metal films on ferromagnetic insulators published on Physical Review B  90, 161412(R) (2014).

In this paper we predict a magnetoresistance induced by the interfacial Rashba spin orbit coupling in a normal metal/ferromagnetic insulator bilayer system. This new magnetoresistance depends on the angle between current and magnetization directions as the recent discovered "spin Hall magnetoresistance" mechanism caused by a combined action of spin Hall and inverse spin Hall effects. Due to the identical phenomenology we question the true origin of the spin Hall magnetoresistance and propose that a normal metal film thickness dependence measurement can clarify which effect, the interfacial Rashba or the bulk spin Hall eff ect, is responsible for the new magnetoresistance.
