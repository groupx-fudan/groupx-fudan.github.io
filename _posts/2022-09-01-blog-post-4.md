Random numbers are essential in many information technologies, especially those concerning cyber security. Nowadays, most random numbers are the pseudo random numbers generated by mathematical algorithms. A compact, fast, and true random number generator (TRNG) is highly desirable.

It has been suggested that a TRNG can be built using a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), leveraging the thermal activation of random magnetization switching. While the MTJ-based TRNG can only operate at a relatively low frequency of 1KHz, there have been numerous attempts to boost its generation rate.

In a recent paper [1], it was theoretically demonstrated and confirmed by simulation that the application of a millitesla magnetic field can significantly reduce the potential barrier between the two equilibrium states, thereby enhancing the random number generation rate of an MTJ-based TRNG by many orders of magnitude, from KHz to GHz. Importantly, the applied field has minimal impact on the read-out of the random numbers in the MTJ.

This paper presents a simple yet effective method for enabling the MTJ as a fast true random number generator. The practical implementation of this method has the potential to transform the MTJ-based TRNG into a commercially competitive device for numerous applications reliant on random numbers.

The primary contributor to this work was Mr. Xiheng Chen, who recently completed his Master's studies at Fudan University and has since transitioned to industry.
