Antiferromagnetic materials are characterized by magnetic moments that orient in opposing directions, leading to their unique properties, including the absence of stray fields and rapid dynamic responses within the terahertz (THz) frequency range. These distinctive features position antiferromagnetic materials as crucial components in the drive toward technological advancements, particularly in fields such as data storage and spintronics. A thorough understanding of their dynamic behavior is imperative to unlocking their full potential in innovative applications.

One puzzling aspect of antiferromagnetic dynamics is the observed broadening of the linewidth in Antiferromagnetic Resonance (AFMR) compared to Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR), especially under conditions where the Gilbert damping is similar for both systems. This discrepancy implies the existence of unique mechanisms that influence antiferromagnetic dynamics, prompting the need for further investigation.

In our recent work, we discovered that the broadening of AFMR linewidth is attributed to the emergence of a damping-like component within the typically dissipationless exchange torque. This phenomenon arises due to the modification of the eigenstate behavior in the presence of Gilbert damping. Specifically, while magnetizations from two magnetic sublattices typically exhibit anti-alignment during precession, Gilbert damping introduces a phase delay between them as illustrated in the figure below, resulting in a tilt of the exchange torque from field-like to damping-like contributions.

Moreover, the work offers additional insights through two alternative interpretations. The first explanation posits that the transverse component of the exchange coupling acts as a dissipative coupling, ultimately reducing the AFMR frequency and increasing the damping rate. The second interpretation invokes the concept of two-mode squeezing, suggesting that the antiferromagnetic eigenmodes resemble squeezed states, further enhancing the damping effect.

This work, recently published on Physical Review B, was primarily conducted by Mr. Yutian Wang.
