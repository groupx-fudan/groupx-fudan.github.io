### Misc.

I am a geography fan. I like geography since very young age, so I always have a huge world map in my room. I used to take the Geography Quiz from time to time. I have submitted correct answers a couple of times, four of which
1. [Bergen, Norway](/_posts/images/geoquiz_bergen_med.jpeg)  (text in red are visible after correct answers are submitted),
2. [The Republic of Kirabati](/_posts/images/geoquiz_kirabati_med.png), 
3. [Hania, Crete Island, Greece](/_posts/images/geoquiz_hania_med.png),
4. [Pyongyang, North Korea](/_posts/images/geoquiz_pyongyang_med.png),

were the first correct answers submitted, so I won 4 x 100$ prize from the website. Maybe because of the above reason, I am also enthusiastic about traveling. So far, Iâ€™ve travelled to over 30 countries across 5 continents, including
1. Asia (11): China, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Iran, Japan, Turkey, Israel, Singapore, South Korea, Saudi Arabia. 
2. Europe (18): The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Belgium, Greece, France, Monaco, Germany, United Kingdom, Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, Cezch Republic, Italy, Switzerland, Russia.
3. North/South America (6): United States, Mexico, Argentina, Panama, Canada, Peru.
4. Africa (1): Kenya.
