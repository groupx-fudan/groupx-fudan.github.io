**Misc.** 

I am a geography fan. I like geography since very young age, so I always have a huge world map in my room. I used to take the Geography Quiz from time to time. I have submitted correct answers a couple of times, four of which (Bergen, Norway, The Republic of Kirabati, Hania, Crete Island, Greece, Pyongyang, North Korea) were the first correct answers submitted, so I won 4 x 100$ prize from the website. Maybe because of the above reason, I am also enthusiastic about traveling. So far, I’ve travelled to over 30 countries across 5 continents, including 
    - Asia (10): China, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Iran, Japan, Turkey, Israel, Singapore, South Korea. 
    - Europe (18): The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Belgium, Greece, France, Monaco, Germany, United Kingdom, Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, Cezch Republic, Italy, Switzerland, Russia.
    - North/South America (6): United States, Mexico, Argentina, Panama, Canada, Peru.
    - Africa (1): Kenya.
