The first Spin X Workshop was successfully held on Oct. 7th, 2019 in Baolong Hotel, Shanghai. Ten invited speakers from China, Japan, and The Netherlands shared their research ideas on spintronics  ranging from spin mechanics, spin cavitronics, to topological effects in magnetic systems. 

The workshop atmosphere is lively with prolonged hot discussions, and extended for more than 2 hours than planned. 

We would like to thank all the speakers for their contributions to the successful gathering and exchange of ideas. 

The detailed program of the workshop is shown below:
